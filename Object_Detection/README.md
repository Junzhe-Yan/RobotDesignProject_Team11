RealSense Camera Object Detection and Grasping System
This project utilizes an Intel RealSense Camera with OpenCV to perform object detection and compute the 3D coordinates of objects relative to the camera. By transforming these coordinates, a robotic system can execute object grasping.

Features
Capture color and depth images using the RealSense Camera

Perform color-based object detection using OpenCV

Compute 3D coordinates of detected objects relative to the camera

Publish coordinate data for robotic grasping operations
